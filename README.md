## App Overview

Goal Digger is an application intended to keep track of weekly goals, where the user can assign points to each goal.
1  = Easy to accomplish
5  = Medium difficulty to accomplish
10 = Hard to accomplish

By assigning points to this goals, the user can weight the difficulty of being accomplished. At the same time, the user can create rewards and assign points as well.

The intention of this app is to keep track of the points accumulated by accomplish goals and keeping track of how many points are needed to claim a reward.

## Unsolved features:

* Points are not being added
* UPDATE is not working because I was not able to extract a goal id from the array of goals
* Points for rewards are not being added
* Just as goals, I cannot update rewards
* Due date is including local time and I wish to show the date only
* Couldn't have all users page. This page is supposed to show other users points only.
